## My projects

* [Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Patients Using Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/uwnelljy/SphericalCNN)

  * Refined and trained the spherical **CNN** structure for brain image classification with an accuracy of 95%; provided an

    easy, fast and automatic pipeline for diagnosis of early-stage AD.

  * Merged, transformed image data of 607 patients, generated balanced data via over-sampling with data augmentation.

  * Tuned hyperparameter, increased network depth, and applied ReLU to improve model performance using **Pytorch**.

  * Programmed for cloud computing on **HPC GPU** node, visualized loss and accuracy results using **Tensorboard**.

* [Early Stage Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/uwnelljy/EarlystageDiabetesPrediction)

  * Built predictive models using 520 patients’ data and 17 symptoms to predict early-stage diabetes using R.

  * Preprocessed features and trained supervised machine learning models including **logistic regression**, **lasso, KNN,**

    **SVM, naïve Bayes classifier, random forest, AdaBoost**, and **xgboost** using cross-validation.

  * Evaluated the model’s classification performance on testing dataset, generated confusion matrix and report F1 score

* [Clustering COVID-19 publications using NLP](https://github.com/uwnelljy/covid19nlp)

* [Gate assignment at airport using genetic algorithm](https://github.com/uwnelljy/geneticalgo)
